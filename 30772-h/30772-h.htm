<p>The Secretary was directed to inform such
of those gentlemen as are now in this city,

letters.</p>

<p>The Convention being informed, that the
absence of Joseph Bloomfield, of New Jersey,
was occasioned by sickness, mention thereof
was ordered to be made on the Minutes.</p>

<p>The committee, appointed to consider of,
and report, the objects proper for the consideration
of the Convention, and the most
suitable means of attaining the same, made
report, which, after amendment, was adopted
as follows, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p><i>First</i>, That an address be made, by this
Convention, to the several Abolition Societies
in the United States, recommending to them,
to send Deputies to a Convention, similar to
the present, to be holden in Philadelphia the
first day of January, in the year 1796; also,
that it be recommended to those Societies,
who have not sent, to this Convention, complete
copies of the laws of their several states,
relative to slavery, to send, to the next
Convention, copies of all such laws, both
those which are now in force, and those
which have been repealed; and to send, to
the next, and every succeeding, Convention,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
an accurate list of their officers for the time
being, together with an account of the place
of their abode, and of the offices, civil,
military, or ecclesiastic, which they may
sustain, with the number of members of
which they consist: that it be further recommended,
to the several Societies, to send,
annually, to the Convention, an accurate list
of all those persons who have been relieved
and liberated by their agency; and, also, an
account of such trials and decisions of courts,
the general knowledge of which they shall
judge subservient to the cause of abolition:
that it be recommended to the several Societies,
to institute public periodical discourses,
or orations, on the subject of slavery, and
the means of its abolition; also, to continue,
without remission, and in such ways as they
shall, respectively, judge most likely to be
successful, their exertions to procure an amelioration
of the laws of their respective states,
relative to the Blacks; and, at the same time,
to give particular attention to the education
of the black children: and, as an historical
review of the legislative provisions, relative
to slavery, in the several states of the Union,
from their respective settlements to the present
time, would be conducive to the general
benefit,&mdash;that it be further recommended, to
the several Abolition Societies, to take measures
for procuring the materials, and promoting
the publication, of such a work; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
that a communication of the steps taken, in
pursuance of this recommendation, be made
to the ensuing Convention.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, That the Convention take into
consideration the case of those persons, who,
having been made free by the republic of
France, are still holden in slavery by those
who have emigrated into the United States
from the territories of the said republic; and
that the Convention devise some lawful measures
for their relief:&mdash;we barely suggest,
whether an application to the French ambassador
be, or be not, proper in the case.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, That the Convention take into
consideration the means of improving the
condition of the Blacks, who are, or may
be, made free in the different states, and of
preventing the inconveniences that may arise
from the degraded state of the Negroes in
the United States.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, That it be recommended, to the
Society of New Jersey, to enter on proper
measures to procure an amendment of the
law of that state, prohibiting the manumission
of slaves of a greater age than thirty-five
years.</p>

<p>William Johnson, Franklin Davenport,
and Samuel Coates, were appointed to prepare
an address, as proposed in the first and
fourth sections of the above report.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The second section was referred to William
Walton Woolsey, William Rawle, James
Todd, and Edward Scott, to report thereon.</p>

<p>The third section was referred to Lawrence
Embree, Caspar Wistar, Benjamin Say, Joseph
Warner, and Samuel Sterett, to report
thereon.</p>

<p>Samuel Coates, James Sloan, and Joseph
Townsend, were appointed a committee to
enquire, and report, concerning the measures
taken, in pursuance of the several resolutions
of the former Convention, for transmitting
memorials and addresses to the Congress of
the United States, and the Legislatures of
individual states.</p>

<p>Adjourned till to-morrow evening at six

the Providence Society, appeared and took
his seat.</p>

<p>The committee, to whom was referred the
second section of the report of the committee
of arrangement, reported, that they had taken
the subject into consideration; that it appeared
to them, to be within the province of the
several Societies to act therein; and that the
Convention should recommend, to the said
Societies, to exert themselves for the liberation
of the persons described in the said report,
so far as may be consistent with the laws of
their respective states.</p>

<p>Ordered, That the said report be accepted.</p>

<p>The President being absent, Theodore

evening.</p>

<p>The committee, appointed to prepare memorials
to the Legislatures of the states of
Georgia and South Carolina, presented two
essays, which were read; the one to the
Legislature of Georgia, was ordered to lie
on the table; that to the Legislature of South
Carolina, after amendment, was agreed to as
follows, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>To the &mdash;&mdash; of the State of
South Carolina.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The memorial and petition of the Delegates
from the several Societies, formed in different
parts of the United States, for promoting
the abolition of slavery, in Convention
assembled, in Philadelphia, on
the seventh day of January, 1795.</p>

<p><i>Respectfully shew</i>,</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span>, having been deputed, and having
convened, for the purpose of considering,
and carrying into effect, the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
proper measures for the abolition of slavery;
and being forcibly impressed with a sense of
the dangers to which the citizens of the
United States are exposed, while a numerous
class of men exist among them, deprived of
their natural rights, and forcibly held in
bondage;&mdash;we think it our duty to address
you, as men, fellow citizens, and brethren,
and earnestly to request your attention to
the means of avoiding the evils naturally
resulting from the above mentioned unhappy
circumstances.</p>

<p>The first step which we take the liberty
of suggesting to you, is an entire prohibition
of all traffic in slaves, between your state
and every other nation or state, either by
importation or exportation: This is the first
and principal object of our memorial&mdash;an
object which we the more earnestly recommend
to your attention, as we are informed
that the law of your state, prohibiting the
importation of slaves, will expire sometime
in March next.</p>

<p>In considering this subject, many methods
of conciliating the affections of this unfortunate
people, and preparing them for that
state in society upon which depends our political
happiness, suggest themselves:&mdash;such
as, an amelioration of their condition and a
diffusion of knowledge among them. But,
as nothing can be effectual while the number
of slaves may be daily increased by importation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and while the minds of our citizens
are debased, and their hearts hardened, by
contemplating these people only through the
medium of avarice or prejudice (a necessary
consequence of the traffic in man) we confine
the prayer of this petition to the total
prohibition of all traffic in slaves, between
your state and every other nation or state,
either by importation or exportation; which
we respectfully solicit you to grant, having
full confidence, that, independant of other
considerations, you will see the evident policy
of the measure.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The committee, appointed to consider
whether any, and what, amendments appear
necessary in the act, passed by Congress,
prohibiting the carrying on the slave-trade
to any foreign place or country, made report
as follows, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p>The committee, to whom was referred
the consideration of the act of the Congress
of the United States, for prohibiting the
traffic in slaves, report,&mdash;</p>

<p>That, in their opinion, no amendment is
necessary to the law in question. It appears,
to them, to prohibit the exportation of slaves
from America, for the purposes of traffic,
or from any part of any foreign country,
whether a port, river, bay, or coast, to any
other foreign country. The generical term
"place" certainly includes as well the sea as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
the land; and it is, in substance, declared to
be unlawful so to traffic in any place or
manner, except only what the constitution,
at present, denies the power of restraining,
<i>viz.</i> the importation of slaves into the
United States.</p>

<p>Whether further experience may point
out defects at present not seen, the committee
cannot predict. It may not, perhaps,
be prudent to aid avarice and inhumanity
by the attempt.</p>

<p>Ordered, That the said report be accepted.</p>

<p>On motion,</p>

<p>Resolved, That this Convention address
the free black people, in the United States,
exhorting them, by suitable arguments and
motives, to such conduct and behaviour as
may be judged most proper to promote their
own happiness, and render them useful members
of society.</p>

<p>Ordered, That Samuel Coates, Robert
Patterson, and William Dunlap, be a committee
to prepare, and report, an address
conformable to the said resolution.</p>

<p>Adjourned till to-morrow evening at six
o'clock.</p>

<p>The Convention met.</p>

<p>Present&mdash;Uriah Tracy, Zephaniah Swift,
Theodore Foster, William Johnson, Lawrence

Samuel Coates, Caspar Wistar, James Todd,
Benjamin Say, Cyrus Newlin, Joseph Warner,

<p>The address, to the Legislature of the state
of Georgia, was read a second time, and,
being amended, was adopted as follows, <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>To the &mdash;&mdash; of the State of Georgia.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The memorial and petition of the Delegates
from the several Societies, formed in different
parts of the United States, for promoting
the abolition of slavery, in Convention
assembled, in Philadelphia, on
the seventh day of January, 1795.</p>

<p><i>Respectfully shew</i>,</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the Convention, assembled in
the month of January, 1794, addressed
your body on the subject of the African
slave-trade; and the present Convention, not
having been informed of the success of that
memorial, have thought it a duty incumbent
on them, to re-call your attention to some
points nearly connected with the honor of
humanity, and the interest of your state, and
of the United States.</p>

<p>We have learned, with the highest satisfaction,
that you have prohibited the importation
of slaves into your state, from all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
other parts of the world, except Africa. We
congratulate you, and the friends of humanity
in general, on such a step; but the
time, we hope, is not far distant, when
every motive of wisdom and true policy
will lead you to prohibit entirely this species
of commerce. And we, at this time, request
your serious attention to a consideration of
the evil likely to ensue from the continuance
of the traffic, and to the numerous advantages
which must arise from its abolition.
Among the least of these, we would mention
the consistency it would afford to the
American character, now held up, as an
example to the European world; and the
good treatment which might hence be naturally
expected, as likely to be afforded to
those blacks who are already in your country.
To these suggestions, permit us to add
a wish, that you would consider of the propriety
of passing a law, to empower the
owners of slaves to grant their gradual emancipation,
by will or otherwise, as we are well
convinced, that the happiest effects are to be
expected from a progressive abolition of
slavery.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The committee, to whom was re-committed
the address to the several Abolition
Societies, for the purpose of incorporating
therein such other matters as had received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the approbation of the Convention since the
appointment of the first committee,&mdash;presented
one with the additions, which, being
read and amended, was adopted as follows,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>To the &mdash;&mdash; Society for
promoting the abolition of slavery, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Delegates, from the several Abolition
societies in the United States,
convened in this city, express to you, with
great satisfaction, the pleasure they have
experienced from the punctual attendance
of the persons delegated to this Convention,
and that harmony with which they have
deliberated on the several matters that have
been presented to them, at this time, for
their consideration. The benefits which
may flow from a continuance of this general
meeting, by aiding the principal design of
its institution&mdash;the universal emancipation of
the wretched Africans who are yet in bondage,
appear to us so many and important,
that we are induced to recommend to you,
to send Delegates to a similar Convention,
which we propose to be holden, in this city,
on the first day of January, in the year one
thousand, seven hundred and ninety-six.</p>

<p>We have thought it proper to request your
further attention to that part of the address,
of the former Convention, which relates to
the procurement of certified copies of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
laws of your state respecting slavery; and
that you would send, to the next Convention,
exact copies of all such laws as are
now in force; and of such as have been
repealed. Convinced that an historical review
of the various acts and provisions of
the Legislatures of the several states, relating
to slavery, from the periods of their respective
settlements to the present time, by tracing
the progress of the system of African
slavery in this country, and its successive
changes in the different governments of the
Union, would throw much light on the objects
of our enquiry and attention, and enable
us to determine, how far the cause of
justice and humanity has advanced among
us, and how soon we may reasonably expect
to see it triumphant;&mdash;we recommend to
you, to take such measures as you may think
most conducive to that purpose, for procuring
materials for the work now proposed,
and assisting its publication; and to communicate,
to the ensuing Convention, what
progress you shall have made toward perfecting
the plan here offered for your consideration
and care.</p>

<p>Believing that an acquaintance with the
names of the officers of the several Abolition
Societies, would facilitate that friendly correspondence
which ought always to be preserved
between our various associations, we
request that you would send, to the next,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and to every future, Convention, an accurate
list of all the officers of your Society, for
the time being, with the number of members
of which it consists. And it would
assist that Convention in ascertaining the
existing state of slavery in the United States,
if you were to forward to them an exact
account of the persons who have been liberated
by the agency of your Society, and of
those who may be considered as signal instances
of the relief that you have afforded;
and, also, a statement of the number of free
blacks in your state, their property, employments,
and moral conduct.</p>

<p>As a knowledge of what has been done,
and of that success which has attended the
efforts of humanity, will cherish the hope
of benevolence, and stimulate to further
exertion, we trust that you will be of opinion
with us, that it would be highly useful
to procure correct reports of all such trials,
and decisions of courts of judicature, respecting
slavery, a knowledge of which may be
subservient to the cause of abolition, and to
transmit them to the next, or to any future,
Convention.</p>

<p>It cannot have escaped your observation,
how many persons there are who continue
the hateful practice of enslaving their fellow
men, and who acquiesce in the sophistry of
the advocates of that practice, merely from
want of reflection, and from an habitual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
attention to their own immediate interest.
If to such were often applied the force of
reason, and the persuasion of eloquence,
they might be awakened to a sense of their
injustice, and be startled with horror at the
enormity of their conduct. To produce so
desirable a change in sentiment, as well as
practice, we recommend to you the instituting
of annual, or other periodical, discourses,
or orations, to be delivered in public, on the
subject of slavery, and the means of its abolition.</p>

<p>We cannot forbear expressing to you our
earnest desire, that you will continue, without
ceasing, to endeavour, by every method
in your power which can promise any success,
to procure, either an absolute repeal of
all the laws in your state, which countenance
slavery, or such an amelioration of them as
will gradually produce an entire abolition.
Yet, even should that great end be happily
attained, it cannot put a period to the necessity
of further labor. The education of the
emancipated, the noblest and most arduous
task which we have to perform, will require
all our wisdom and virtue, and the constant
exercise of the greatest skill and discretion.
When we have broken his chains, and restored
the African to the enjoyment of his
rights, the great work of justice and benevolence
is not accomplished&mdash;The new born
citizen must receive that instruction, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
those powerful impressions of moral and religious
truth, which will render him capable
and desirous of fulfilling the various duties
he owes to himself and to his country. By
educating some in the higher branches of
science, and all in the useful parts of learning,
and in the precepts of religion and morality,
we shall not only do away the reproach
and calumny so unjustly lavished upon us,
but confound the enemies of truth, by evincing
that the unhappy sons of Africa, in spite
of the degrading influence of slavery, are in
no wise inferior to the more fortunate inhabitants
of Europe and America.</p>

<p>As a mean of effectuating, in some degree,
a design so virtuous and laudable, we
recommend to you to appoint a committee,
annually, or for any other more convenient
period, to execute such plans, for the improvement
of the condition and moral character
of the free blacks in your state, as you may
think best adapted to your particular situation.</p>

<p>By a decree of the National Convention of
France, all the blacks and people of color,
within the territories of the French republic,
are declared free, and entitled to an equal
participation of the rights of citizens of
France. We have been informed that many
persons, of the above description, notwithstanding
the decree in their favor, have been
brought from the West-India islands, by
emigrants, into the United States, and are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
now held as slaves.&mdash;We suggest to you the
propriety, as well as the necessity, of making
enquiry into the subject, and of effecting
their liberation, so far as may be found consistent
with the laws of your state.</p>

<p>Copies of our proceedings will be transmitted
to you, and we hope, that you will
receive such satisfaction as will induce your
early attention to the objects we have here
recommended.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
